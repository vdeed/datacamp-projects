# Analyzing Students' Mental Health

This project explores mental health data from international and domestic students at a Japanese university, based on a 2018 study. The analysis uses SQL to investigate factors such as depression, social connectedness, acculturative stress, and language proficiency.

The goal is to see whether international students are at higher risk of mental health challenges and how factors like length of stay or language skills may play a role.

## Key Focus Areas

- Depression risk by student type (international vs. domestic)
- Correlation between acculturative stress and depression
- Role of social connectedness and language proficiency
- Length of stay as a contributing factor

## Tools

- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Source

Based on a published 2018 survey of students at an international university in Japan. The study was approved by multiple ethical review boards.
