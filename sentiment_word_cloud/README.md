# Sentiment Word Cloud

Small project using basic NLP to visualize word-level sentiment. Each word in the text is colored based on its polarity using `TextBlob`:
- Green = positive
- Red = negative
- Grey = neutral

The text is a short mixed-sentiment paragraph for testing, but you can replace it with any input.

## Tools
- Python
- WordCloud
- TextBlob
- matplotlib

## How to run
Install dependencies if needed:

```bash
pip install wordcloud textblob matplotlib
