# EV Charging Habits in Residential Buildings

As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, shared charging stations in residential buildings are in higher demand. This project explores charging behavior across users and garages to help apartment managers better understand peak usage, session durations, and user types.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:
- Differences between shared vs. private charging stations
- Hourly and weekday patterns of usage
- Electricity consumption and session duration trends

The goal is to help building managers improve access and plan infrastructure upgrades.


## ðŸ§° Tools
